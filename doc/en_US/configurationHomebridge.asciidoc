In the Homebridge setup, you may :

* *User* : Allow Homebridge to use one of your Jeedom User's ApiKey
* *Homebridge Name* : Give an explicit name to your Homebridge. *IMPORTANT : Homekit applications will need to be reconfigured upon name change*
* *Homebridge Mac* : Allow you to manage several Homebridges on the same network. *IMPORTANT : Homekit applications will need to be reconfigured upon Mac change*
* *Empty Cache* : Allow you to empty the Homebridge Cache. On the next start, Homebridge will rescan Jeedom devices to add them back. *IMPORTANT : Homekit applications will need to be reconfigured upon cache deletion*
* *Config File Regen* : Regen the config file when you modify the PIN or name.
* *Homebridge PIN* : Customize your Homebridge PIN. After you save, you'll need a Config File Regen. 

*Usage*

There is 2 ways to interract with Homebridge :

*Please Note*

* Homebridge can't create the Jeedom's Rooms in Homekit yet. 
* In any case, it's possible to use Siri to interract with your device, but you'll have to name your device wisely, Siri is quite strict.
* If you have an AppleTV (or an iOS 10+ iPad) you'll be able to interract with your devices from remote location.
* If you have an AppleTV with tvOS 10+, you'll be able to interract with your device with the remote's Siri button. Scenes from Home will be available too.
